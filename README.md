# supermarket-pricing

This repository contains a Clojure based model for a supermarket pricing system. The aim is to represent a shopping basket and receipt in a way that allows for different pricing structures like:

* Three tins of beans for the price of two
* Onions for 29p / kg
* Two cans of coca-cola for £1
* Any 3 ales from the set {...} for £6
